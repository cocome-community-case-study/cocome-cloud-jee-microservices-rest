This short report summarizes implementation decisions, technology descriptions and other important information we gathered during the implementation of the microservice-based variant of CoCoME. The implementation was based on a practical course by Nils Sommer, who has already created the basic architecture, more precisely the mvn projects for each service, a ORM model for each service and the basic REST communication interfaces for each service. Those services are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Store
	\item Product
	\item Order
	\item Report
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Regarding the implementation, Sommer already crated a documentation\footnote{https://github.com/cocome-community-case-study/cocome-cloud-jee-microservices-rest/blob/master/doc/report.pdf} where he introduces the architecture and more important, the glassfish and maven deployment. \\

This document does not aim to fully describe the architecture with text diagrams and so on. It simply describes each decision that was made during the implementation. The order is completely arbitrary and does not follow a schema.The next chapter summarizes each decision and information as own Section.
