Reports Service
===============

## Deployment Setup

**Prerequisites**: Java8, Maven and Glassfish installed and ready to use.

Before the first deployment, the domain for the jee application (which is the products microservice) has to be created.


```bash
asadmin create-domain --portbase 8600 reportsmicroservice
```

### Deploying into Glassfish

Start the database and domain first.

```bash
asadmin start-domain reportsmicroservice
```

Then use maven to compile the sources, build the deployment package and deploy to glassfish.

```bash
mvn -s settings.xml install
```

Undeploying works using maven as well.

```bash
mvn -s settings.xml clean post-clean
```
